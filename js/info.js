Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Upgrade your ship with items from shop!
Be careful. Hitpoints mustn't go down to 0!

Good luck!`;

const guide = `Attack enemies to earn resourses.
Npcs in the bottom of the list are dangerous!
Don't attack quattroid until you will be able 
to kill 4-5 magmiuses in a row! It's a very strong.

If hitpoints (green line) drop to 0, your 
ship will be destroyed and progress lost.

Enemy kills give you exp, btc and plt.
With btc and plt buy equipment in shop. 
Experience increase your lvl and rank.

Guns increase your damage. Shields and 
ship upgrades increase your total hitpoints.

You can have maximum 5 guns and shields, 
but each drone increases that number!

Use autofarm button to develop faster (click it or press "Q")
To open menu you may press "P"`;

/* 
I published link for the game in my discord group.
Link-invitation: https://discord.gg/tshU2eTt or you can find link under any of my YT videos.

made today:
- menu improved. Added equipment section and now you can sell items from there.

soon: 
- improved menu (yes, again)
- promocodes (that add warrank)

probably (in future):
- quests
- warranks
- upgrades
- extensions
- images for each npc (need images with opacity)

problems:
- background image doesn't load fast on phones

ideas:
- make warranks available for special promocodes or for very high exp
- fastrep may be upgraded, wshield blocks 80% of dmg, emp increases missed by 10 times, entrans heals during fight + animation and sounds.
- в настройках опции отключения анимации и звука
